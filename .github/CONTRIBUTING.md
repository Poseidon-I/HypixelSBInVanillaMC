# Contributing to the wiki

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the plugin wiki. Please use the following steps to start contributing.

Prerequisites: Install Git onto your machine.
* Step 1: Fork the repository.
* Step 2: Clone the repository onto your machine using `git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git` (replace `<USERNAME>` with your GitHub username, and `<REPOSITORY_NAME>` with the name of your fork, default is `HypixelSBInVanillaMC`)
* Step 3: Run `cd HypixelSBInVanillaMC`, then run `git checkout autowiki origin/autowiki` to checkout the `autowiki` branch.
* Step 4: Edit the files located in `.wiki` and save it.
* Step 5: Once all necessary files have been edited, run `git add .wiki` then `git commit` and add a commit message. If the commit doesn't show on GitHub, you may need to run `git push`.
* Step 6: Submit a pull request to [Poseidon-I/HypixelSBInVanillaMC](https://github.com/Poseidon-I/HypixelSBInVanillaMC/pulls). Make sure the base and head branches are set to `autowiki` and describe your Pull Request. If you are testing with the workflow file using your own secrets, **ensure `Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers`** is turned off.
* Step 7: Wait for approval.
