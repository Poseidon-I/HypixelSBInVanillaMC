# Hypixel SkyBlock in Vanilla Minecraft plugin
Disclaimers: 
* This plugin is a remake of select Hypixel SkyBlock items and mobs added directly to base Vanilla Minecraft. It is not the entirety of Hypixel SkyBlock and does not incorporate any features from there except for the selected items and mobs.
* This plugin is a fan project by a SkyBlock sweat and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Hypixel.
* **This plugin is intended to be used without any other combat-related plugins. It has not been tested with other plugins (and probably won't be for the foreseeable future)**
